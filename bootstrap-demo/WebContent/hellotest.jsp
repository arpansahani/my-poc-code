Mr. Donchev was a Minister of EU Funds, now he is the Deputy Prime Minister of EU Funds and Economic Policies. The fact is, he left a large wage as a European member of parliament and stayed here so we could fulfill our program connected to the EU funds. This is especially important when considering over 70% of our financial resource comes from Europe. First we need to fix our finances to the level they once were and then we can aim for an increase. Bulgaria was an example for responsible reforms and financial maintenance for the region of Greece, Romania, Serbia and the Balkans in general. To place this in perspective, the monitoring reports by the EU for Bulgaria in the past were done every year and a half whereas Romaniaâ€™s was done every six months; unfortunately, now it going to be done the other way around. So you can see I need to depend a lot on the financial and economic departments to regenerate the good name of Bulgaria in order to bring forth more investors. When there is no financial stability, no political stability, no judicial reform it is viewed as a risk to foreign investors. Mr. Donchev will be pivotal with these objectives.
